# Investment Portfolio Validation Analysis for a Post-Trade Financial Services firm

Problem Description :

Billions of dollars are traded in the stock market exchange everyday. The price of companies fluctuate hourly relative to the market behavior. Information regarding a stock is normally incomplete, complex, uncertain and vague, making it a challenge to predict the future economic performance. An interested investor would want to accurately understand market movements. There comes a need for a strong predictive model ( in comparison with the existing fundamental technical analysis, machine learning models ) to make informed investments that maximizes profitability.


▪ Gathered business objectives and continually collaborated with the data science team of the finance firm and built solution for a real-world problem of portfolio validation.

▪ Developed a multi-modal algorithm that combined news headlines as word embeddings with numerical stock features in a bi-directional LSTM to predict price trends and achieved 70-90% confidence on investment validation for: IBM, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL. - https://github.com/Aishwarya2795/Investment-portfolio-validation-analysis-for-post-trade-financial-services-firm/blob/master/PART%205%20-%20STOCK%20PRICE%20PREDICTION%20USING%20WORD%20EMBEDDINGS%20IN%20BI-LSTM%20.ipynb

▪ Feature engineered numerical data using supervised gradient boosting (xgboost) and identified that Volume, EMA and MACD were indicators with highest correlation.- https://github.com/Aishwarya2795/Investment-portfolio-validation-analysis-for-post-trade-financial-services-firm/blob/master/PART%202%20-%20FEATURE%20ENGINEERING%20STOCKS%20-%20GRADIENT%20BOOSTING.ipynb

▪ Pinpointed exact days of unusual market behavior using unsupervised deep learning technique – self organized maps after experiments with various techniques. - https://github.com/Aishwarya2795/Investment-portfolio-validation-analysis-for-post-trade-financial-services-firm/blob/master/PART%203%20-%20DETECTION%20OF%20UNUSUAL%20MARKET%20BEHAVIOR.ipynb
