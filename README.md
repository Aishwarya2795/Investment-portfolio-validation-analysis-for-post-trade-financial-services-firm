# Investment Portfolio Validation Analysis for a Post-Trade Financial Services firm

Problem Description :

Billions of dollars are traded in the stock market exchange everyday. The price of companies fluctuate hourly relative to the market behavior. Information regarding a stock is normally incomplete, complex, uncertain and vague, making it a challenge to predict the future economic performance. An interested investor would want to accurately understand market movements. There comes a need for a strong predictive model ( in comparison with the existing fundamental technical analysis, machine learning models ) to make informed investments that maximizes profitability.


▪ Gathered business objectives and continually collaborated with the data science team of the finance firm and built solution for a real-world problem of portfolio validation.
▪ Developed a multi-modal algorithm that combined news headlines as word embeddings with numerical stock features in a bi-directional LSTM to predict price trends and achieved 70-90% confidence on investment validation for: IBM, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL.
▪ Feature engineered numerical data using supervised gradient boosting (xgboost) and identified that Volume, EMA and MACD were indicators with highest correlation.
▪ Pinpointed exact days of unusual market behavior using unsupervised deep learning technique – self organized maps after experiments with various techniques.
