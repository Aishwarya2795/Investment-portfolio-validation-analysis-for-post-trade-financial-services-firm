# Investment portfolio validation analysis using stock data  

Problem Description :

Billions of dollars are invested in the stock market everyday. The price of companies fluctuate hourly relative to the market behavior. Information regarding a stock is normally incomplete, complex, uncertain and vague, making it a challenge to predict the future economic performance. An interested investor would want to accurately understand market movements. There comes a need for a strong predictive model ( in comparison with the existing fundamental technical analysis, machine learning models ) to make informed investments that maximizes profitability.
